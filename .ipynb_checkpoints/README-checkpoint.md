This mini-project applies basic data mining techniques for clustering mall customers based on their annual income and spending score.

## 🔍 Dataset
A simulated version of the popular mall customer dataset, containing:
- Customer ID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (in thousands)
- Spending Score (1–100)

## 🧪 Methodology
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters
- K-Means clustering
- Visualization using Seaborn

## 📦 Tools
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Output
Visual clusters that help identify different customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
